      "options": ["1/5", "1/10", "1/20", "10"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "If total work is 1, then 1 day work = 1/10."

      "question": "A can do a work in 12 days and B in 6 days. In how many days will they complete the work together?",
      "options": ["3 days", "4 days", "6 days", "8 days"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "(1/12 + 1/6) = 3/12 = 1/4, so time = 4 days."

      "question": "If A is twice as efficient as B, and B takes 12 days to complete a work, how many days will A take?",
      "options": ["3 days", "4 days", "6 days", "8 days"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Efficiency A:B = 2:1 → Time ratio = 1:2 → A takes 12/2 = 6 days."

      "options": ["2 days", "3 days", "5 days", "10 days"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Men × Days = constant → (5 × 10) / 10 = 5 days."

      "options": ["1/3", "1/5", "1/15", "3/15"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "1 day work = 1/15 → 3 days work = 3/15 = 1/5."

      "question": "A and B together can do a work in 8 days. A alone can do it in 12 days. In how many days can B alone do it?",
      "options": ["12 days", "18 days", "24 days", "6 days"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "(A+B) = 1/8, A = 1/12 → B = 1/8 − 1/12 = 1/24 → 24 days."

      "options": ["5 days", "10 days", "15 days", "20 days"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "A is twice efficient → takes half the time → 20/2 = 10 days."

      "options": ["2:3", "3:2", "1:2", "4:3"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Efficiency ∝ 1/Time → A:B = 12:8 = 3:2."

      "options": ["9 days", "10 days", "12 days", "15 days"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "1/4 work = 3 days → full work = 3 × 4 = 12 days."
