    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "A tangent PQ at a point P of a circle of radius 5 cm meets a line through the center O at a point Q such that OQ = 12 cm. Find the length of PQ.",
      "options": ["13 cm", "8.5 cm", "√119 cm", "17 cm"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Since radius is perpendicular to the tangent, OPQ is a right triangle. PQ² = OQ² - OP² = 12² - 5² = 144 - 25 = 119. So, PQ = √119 cm."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "A chord of length 16 cm is at a distance of 6 cm from the center of a circle. What is the radius of the circle?",
      "options": ["8 cm", "10 cm", "12 cm", "14 cm"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The perpendicular from the center bisects the chord. Leg 1 = 8 cm, Leg 2 = 6 cm. Radius² = 8² + 6² = 100. Radius = 10 cm."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "If the angle subtended by an arc at the center is 110°, what is the angle subtended by it at the circumference?",
      "options": ["55°", "110°", "220°", "70°"],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "The angle at the center is double the angle at the circumference. 110 / 2 = 55°."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "In a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD, if ∠A = 80°, what is the measure of ∠C?",
      "options": ["80°", "100°", "90°", "120°"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Opposite angles in a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary (sum to 180°). 180 - 80 = 100°."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "What is the perimeter of a semi-circle with radius 7 cm? (Use π = 22/7)",
      "options": ["22 cm", "36 cm", "44 cm", "58 cm"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Perimeter = πr + 2r = (22/7 × 7) + (2 × 7) = 22 + 14 = 36 cm."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "The length of the tangent from an external point P to a circle is 24 cm. If the distance of P from the center is 25 cm, find the radius.",
      "options": ["7 cm", "10 cm", "12 cm", "15 cm"],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "Using Pythagoras theorem: Radius² = 25² - 24² = 625 - 576 = 49. Radius = 7 cm."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "If two circles of radii 5 cm and 3 cm touch each other internally, what is the distance between their centers?",
      "options": ["8 cm", "4 cm", "2 cm", "1 cm"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "For internal touching, distance between centers = R - r = 5 - 3 = 2 cm."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "Find the area of a sector of a circle with radius 6 cm if the angle of the sector is 60°.",
      "options": ["3π cm²", "6π cm²", "12π cm²", "36π cm²"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Area = (θ/360) × πr² = (60/360) × π × 6² = 1/6 × 36π = 6π cm²."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "Angles in the same segment of a circle are:",
      "options": ["Complementary", "Supplementary", "Equal", "Unequal"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "It is a standard geometric theorem that angles subtended by the same arc in the same segment are always equal."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "What is the angle subtended by a diameter at any point on the circumference?",
      "options": ["45°", "60°", "90°", "180°"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The angle in a semi-circle is always a right angle (90°)."
