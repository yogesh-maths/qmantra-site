    {
      "id": 1,
      "question": "What is the probability of getting a head when a fair coin is tossed?",
      "options": ["0", "1/4", "1/2", "1"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "A fair coin has two equally likely outcomes: Head and Tail. So probability = 1/2."
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "question": "A dice is thrown once. What is the probability of getting an even number?",
      "options": ["1/6", "1/3", "1/2", "2/3"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Even numbers are 2, 4, 6 → 3 outcomes out of 6 → 3/6 = 1/2."
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "question": "What is the probability of getting a number greater than 4 on a die?",
      "options": ["1/6", "1/3", "1/2", "2/3"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Numbers greater than 4 are 5 and 6 → 2/6 = 1/3."
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "question": "A card is drawn from a deck of 52 cards. What is the probability of getting a red card?",
      "options": ["1/4", "1/13", "1/2", "3/4"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "There are 26 red cards out of 52 → 26/52 = 1/2."
    },
    {
      "id": 5,
      "question": "What is the probability of getting a prime number on a die?",
      "options": ["1/6", "1/3", "1/2", "2/3"],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Prime numbers on a die are 2, 3, 5 → 3/6 = 1/2."
    },
    {
      "id": 6,
      "question": "If two coins are tossed, what is the probability of getting exactly one head?",
      "options": ["1/4", "1/2", "3/4", "1"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Possible outcomes: HH, HT, TH, TT → exactly one head in HT, TH → 2/4 = 1/2."
    },
    {
      "id": 7,
      "question": "What is the probability of drawing an ace from a pack of cards?",
      "options": ["1/13", "1/26", "1/52", "4/13"],
      "correctAnswer": 0,
      "explanation": "There are 4 aces out of 52 cards → 4/52 = 1/13."
    },
    {
      "id": 8,
      "question": "A bag contains 5 red and 3 blue balls. What is the probability of drawing a blue ball?",
      "options": ["3/5", "3/8", "5/8", "1/2"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Total balls = 8, blue balls = 3 → probability = 3/8."
    },
    {
      "id": 9,
      "question": "What is the probability of getting tail when a coin is tossed?",
      "options": ["0", "1/2", "1/4", "1"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Tail is one of two equally likely outcomes → probability = 1/2."
    },
    {
      "id": 10,
      "question": "A card is drawn at random. What is the probability that it is not a face card?",
      "options": ["3/13", "10/13", "1/13", "9/13"],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Face cards = 12 → Non-face cards = 52 − 12 = 40 → 40/52 = 10/13."
